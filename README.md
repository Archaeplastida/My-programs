# About this repository
> Hello to whoever is reading this. I am a beginner Python programmer.
---
- I will attempt to collaborate/help fellow beginners. If I can't do it, look for help elsewhere.
- This a repository for welcome to people who like to help beginners, or is a fellow beginner to Python.
- Sometimes, I will post programs that I made from Python, just to show what my experience level is at.
- remember this too... **I am very new to Github and Python** at the moment I typed this (5/4/2022).
- If I don't know how to do a certain thing on Github: it is because I am not that good at Github (lol second time mentioning)
